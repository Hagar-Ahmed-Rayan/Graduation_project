Medical Report generation  is a system that helps radiologists  to generate reports from medical images especially chest x-ray to diagnose patients automatically which helps to reduce the workload of radiologists in writing medical reports this is  using deep learning models “R2Gen transformer-based, Co-attention CNN-LSTM based”.
Also, it helps the patient to understand this  report  because Medical words  are not easy to understand by translating the report or  extracting important  medical words as a summarization to the report  this  is using  NLP and translation APIs words from the report.
The radiologists only can upload  2  chest X-rays as input to the system, then the report is generated automatically.
