Medical Report generation  is a  system that helps radiologists  to generate reports from medical images to diagnose patients automatically which helps to reduce the workload of radiologists in writing medical reports this is  using deep learning models “R2Gen transformer based, Co-attention CNN-LSTM based”.
Also, it helps the patient to understand the report by translating the report or  appearing important  medical words as summarization to the report because Medical diagnosis is not easy to understand  this  is using  NLP and translation APIs 
The radiologists only can upload  2  chest X-rays as input to the system, then the report is generated automatically.
